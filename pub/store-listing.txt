Full description:
This app adds Central Fraser Valley Transit System (BC Transit) buses information to MonTransit.

This app provides the buses schedule and news from YouTube and @BCTransit on Twitter.

CFV Transit System buses serve Abbotsford, Mission in British Columbia, Canada.

Once this application is installed, the MonTransit app will display buses information (schedule...).

This application only has a temporary icon and no screen: download the MonTransit app (free) in the "More ..." section bellow or by following this Google Play link http://goo.gl/pCk5mV

You can install this application on the SD card but it is not recommended.

The information comes from the GTFS file provided by BC Transit.
